# King Of Secret Society for Civilization VI

A secret society created with the idea using all other societies' promotions as unique policy cards in the Wildcard slots. Can be unlocked by all four ways (sending an Envoy, discovering a Natural Wonder, discovering a Tribal Village, and destroying a Barbarian Camp). After all, it is the "king"!
